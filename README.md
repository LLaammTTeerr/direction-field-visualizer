# Direction Field Visualizer

Today my Calculus II teacher ask us to draw the line field of some function. To me this is unnecessary because a modern computer can easily do that. But my teacher argues that if the computer draw than I will understand nothing about this.

So I create my own visualizer to prove that this is f**king easy to do. This took me about ~2h to do everything.

Cheer!!!
